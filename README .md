# Getting and Cleaning Data Project 

### This file explains how run_analysus.R works

The Samsung data should be in the working directory
The R code is commented step by step. 
These are the differents steps that it follows:

## 1. Read data, combine them and add descriptive names

- Read train and test data 
- Append the two data tables
- Read and append the subject ids and activity ids data
- Add correspondent subject ids and activity ids to train+test dataset
- Read the feature names and apply them to the combined data

## 2. Filter mean and standard deviation columns and get descriptive activity names

- Filter to keep just the mean and standard deviation measures (as well as the subject and activity ids)
- Read the activity descriptive names and add descriptive names to its columns
- Join the activity names data with the filtered data using the activity ids on both datasets


## 3. Calculate the mean of each variable for each combination of subject-activity and create the solution .txt file

- Calculate the mean of every variable grouped by Activity and Subject id
- Drop redundant variables generated by the aggregate function
- Create .txt file to be uploaded
